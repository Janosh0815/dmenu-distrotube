dmenu is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for dwm. It manages large numbers of user-defined menu items efficiently.  It is a very powerful tool that allows you to pipe information into it.  This makes dmenu a perfect utility to incorporate into your scripting.

This launches dmenu_run with -c (centered), -bw (border width), -l (number of vertical lines) and -g (number of grid columns).
